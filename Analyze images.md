# Get started with image analysis on Azure
The Computer Vision service is a **cognitive service** in Microsoft Azure that provides pre-built computer vision capabilities. The service can analyze images, and return detailed information about an image and the objects it depicts.

### Updation
**Cognitive Services:** Cognitive Services are a set of machine learning algorithms that Microsoft has developed to solve problems in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The goal of Cognitive Services is to democratize AI by packaging it into discrete components that are easy for developers to use in their own apps.

# Exercise - Analyze images with the Computer Vision service

* The screenshot of each code consumes more space. Preferably just list the instructions and at the end of the unit, a demo video of maximum 2mins explains the exercise for those who encounter difficulties. 

# Knowledge check

**The number of questions in knowledge check can be increased so that learner can make sure that he has good knowledge of the concept.**

Some additional questions can be:

* Which of the following is a challenge when dealing with computer vision problems?
  * Variations due to geometric changes (like pose, scale etc)
  * Variations due to photometric factors (like illumination, appearance etc)
  * Image occlusion
  * All of the above

* Finite difference filters in image processing are very susceptible to noise. To cope up with this, which of the following methods can you use so that there would be minimal distortions by noise?
  * Downsample the image
  * Convert the image to grayscale from RGB
  * Smooth the image
  * None of the above

**There can be a timer while checking the knowledge. This will encourage user to give the test within the alloted time.**

**There can be a challenge lab for students to implement what they learned.**

# Summary and clean-up  
The Computer Vision service provides many capabilities:
* Use to analyze images 
* Use to generate a descriptive caption
* It can extract relevant tags
* It can identify objects
* It can determine image type and metadata
* It can detect human faces, known brands and celebrities, and others.

## Clean-up

* It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money.

* If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

* If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

### How to clean up :
* In the Azure portal, in the Resource groups page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

* Click Delete resource group, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select Delete. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking Delete.
