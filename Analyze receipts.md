* Explain more the pre-built receipt model and demonstrates how the variation of the guidelines(images format, size..) will affect the result of the custom model 

* Same remarques for the exercise unit and knowledge check unit. 
* At the end we may add another unit for some real life projects suggestions that the learner could practice by him/herself related to different services. It is such a collection of many projects taking place at the last unit of the module.
