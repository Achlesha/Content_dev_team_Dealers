# Introduction
Image classification is a common workload in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. It harnesses the predictive power of machine learning to enable AI systems to identify real-world items based on images.

# Uses of image classification
Some potential uses for image classification are:

* Product identification: performing visual searches for specific products in online searches or even, in-store using a mobile device.
* Disaster investigation: identifying key infrastructure for major disaster preparation efforts. For example, identifying bridges and roads in aerial images can help disaster relief teams plan ahead in regions that are not well mapped.
* Medical diagnosis: evaluating images from X-ray or MRI devices could quickly classify specific issues found as cancerous tumors, or many other medical conditions related to medical imaging diagnosis.

# Understand classification
You can use a machine learning classification technique to predict which category, or class, something belongs to.

Classification machine learning models uses:
* a set of inputs, which we call features, to calculate a probability score for each possible class and predict a label that indicates the most likely class that an object belongs to.

For example, the features of a flower might include the measurements of its petals, stem, sepals, and other quantifiable characteristics. 
A machine learning model could be trained by applying an algorithm to these measurements that calculates the most likely species of the flower - its class.

# Understand image classification
Image classification is a machine learning technique in which the object being classified is an image, such as a photograph.

To create an image classification model, you need data that consists of features and their labels. The existing data is a set of categorized images. 

**Digital images are made up of an array of pixel values, and these are used as features to train the model based on the known image classes.**

# Get started with image classification on Azure
Content is well organized 

# Exercise - Create an image classification solution
The screenshot of each code consumes more space. Preferably just list the instructions and at the end of the unit, a demo video of maximum 2mins explains the exercise for those who encounter difficulties.

# Knowledge check
**In knowledge check more questions can be added so that learner can make sure that he has good knowledge of the concept.**
Some additional questions can be:

* You want to train a model that classifies images of dog and cats based on collection of your own digital photographs. Which azure service should you use?
* You want to use computer vision service to identify location of individual item in an image. Which of the following feature should you retreive?
  * Objects
  * Classes
  * All of the above

**There can be a timer while checking the knowledge. This will encourage user to give the test within the alloted time.**

**There can be a challenge lab for students to implement what they learned.**
  
 # Summary
 * The Custom Vision service simplifies the process for creating custom image classification models and deploying AI solutions.
 * You can use the service to automate processes with minimal knowledge of deep learning techniques.

# Clean-up
* It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money.

* If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

* If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

### How to clean up :
* In the Azure portal, in the Resource groups page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

* Click Delete resource group, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select Delete. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking Delete.
